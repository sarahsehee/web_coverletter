Back then, there werenâ€™t many choices of prototyping tools other than pen-and-paper mockup and form core. Rarely some students dived into the sea of coding, but not many people returned successfully. Prototyping wasnâ€™t a tremendous issue because everyone was quite satisfied with their filthy paper models like Pop!<br> My concern about effective communication escalated as soon as I landed in Silicon Valley as an interaction designer. Unlike hardware products that I studied in school, there are too many screens, animations, and endless iterations after multiple cycles of user testing. It was impossible to get a tool that is \"just right\". I spend overnight working on a prototype that is half-done, failed to get a feedback I desperately needed and couldnâ€™t go on mythical five-person usability testing because I was already exhausted from prototyping.<br><br>I believe my journey to find a just-right prototyping tool and a broad range of interaction design career will work like magical sprinkles in baking future Pies. I am ready to join ProtoPie to help fellow designers to save their precious time and get confident in their design process as I didâœ¨",
